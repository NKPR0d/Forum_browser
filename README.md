# Audiogames forum browser
A program designed for fast and convenient browsing on the audiogames forum.
I was inspired by the forum browser version written by someone a long time ago and rewrote it for nvgt, at the same time optimizing it and making it work with the current html structure of the forum pages.

## Controls:
Up/ down arrows: Scroll through the menus.
Left/ Right arrows: Scroll through the pages of topics or posts.
Space: Jump to the desired page.
Enter: Select a menu item or, if on a post, copy it to the clipboard.
Escape: Back or exit.

Enjoy or what ever you want with this thingy!
